## Tailwind css

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.

`npm install -D tailwindcss postcss`

`npx tailwindcss init` - This creates a tailwind.config.css

Create a `.postcssrc` file in your project root, and enable the tailwindcss plugin.
